"""One-shot installation of shell tab-completion for the smolvm CLI.

fish autoloads per-command completion files from its completions
directory, so a single file write is enough there. bash and zsh do have
autoload mechanisms too (bash-completion's drop-in directory, zsh's
``fpath``), but both only work when the machine has them set up, so for
a setup that works everywhere we write the script under
``~/.smolvm/completions`` and manage one marker-tagged ``source`` line
in the shell's startup file instead.
