"""Auto-activate a pending ``kvm`` group membership for the current CLI run.

When a user runs ``sudo usermod -aG kvm $USER``, the new group only takes
effect for *new* login sessions. Their current shell (and any child
processes, including ``smolvm``) keeps the old group set, so ``/dev/kvm``
remains inaccessible until they log out and back in. This module detects
that exact state and re-execs the CLI under ``sg kvm -c …`` so the kvm
group is active for the rest of the run, sparing first-time users a
manual ``newgrp`` or relog.

Linux-only. Returns immediately on macOS and other platforms.
